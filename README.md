# Rocky-Linux_RHCSA
Compilation of studies, scenarios, tests, fixes and everything I'm doing within Rocky VM.

Inside this repository, you will find a collection of themes that encompass what is needed for the RHCSA - creation of physical volumes, volume groups, logical volumes , basics of hardening, handling SELinux, granular sudo delegation and much more.

Screenshots are made from either the virtualbox setting that I have installed, or through an ssh from my host pc.
